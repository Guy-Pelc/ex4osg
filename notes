notes

-stuff to check:

do i need to check corner case vm size == offset size? then table depth is 0 and then what...?


corner case - physical address must have at least 2 frames. else what?

-how to divide levels if number of bits does not fit exactly? for example: 
VW=10, offset=4 
lvl 1 -> 4 bits, lvl 2->2 bits or opposite?
