notes

-stuff to check:

V 	do i need to check corner case vm size == offset 	 size? then table depth is 0 and then what...?
	i can assume valid constants.

v corner case - physical address must have at least 2   f rames. else what?

v -how to divide levels if number of bits does not fit exactly? for example: 
VW=10, offset=4 
lvl 1 -> 4 bits, lvl 2->2 bits or opposite?
